# HerFutur
Working website prototype developed based on a design concept from _HackWestern_ hackathon in November 2020, using HTML and CSS. 
The original design concept can be viewed here: [Design Concept](./DesignPrototype.pdf)

The website was deployed using Netlify and can be viewed here: [HerFutur Website](https://herfutur.netlify.app/)

### Next Steps:
- Complete the 'Connect' page.
- Fix the colours of the boxes on the 'Educate' page so the image of each section matches the background colour of the textbox.
- Edit the headers of each page to resemble more to the prototype (curved shapes).
